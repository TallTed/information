# 17th October 2019 

Hello and welcome to another edition of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org. This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/weekly-updates/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Weekly Solid Call

Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid. 

The next Solid Weekly will be at 1600 CEST on the 24th October on [this line](https://whereby.com/solid-project) where [Michiel de Jong](https://github.com/michielbdejong) will be giving a special introduction to Solid app development.

## Standardisation

Read more about the [scope of the standardisation work](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/1) being carried out by panellists and editors between now and the 19th December here. [Contributions are welcome.](https://github.com/solid/process)

There are no updates from the editors on the standardisation work this week. 

## Solid Implementations

The [Node Solid Server 5.2.0](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/releases/tag/v5.2.0) was released. This includes a new version of the Solid Data Browser and a much needed fix to the handling of content-types. 

If you have any new apps, Pods, or identity providers, or there are updates to existing Solid implementations, make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next week's edition.

Until next week!
