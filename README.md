# What is Solid? 

Solid is led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, and originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a non-commercial, open source collaboration between thousands of contributors from across the world.

Solid separates user identification from data storage from data usage: 

1.	Login: Solid identification online is designed so that it is independent from parties that could access who users are interacting with

	2.	Pods: Solid data storage is designed so that data is stored safely by the user independently of how that data is used in a recyclable reusable manor 
  
	3.	Apps: Solid applications have granular access to user data meaning they only get a specific type of data necessary to deliver the service provided

# Build
Anyone can implement the Solid [specification](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

Find out who is working on Solid implementations and let others know about how you are implementing Solid on the [App](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps), [Pod](https://github.com/solid/pods), and [Identity Provider](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list) listings. 

You can also use or contribute to the Solid [documentation](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/documentation.md) explaining how to implement the Solid specification. 

If you are looking for funding to be able to build on Solid read this list of [funding opportunities](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/resources.md). 

# Develop 
Solid is an open source project which anyone can contribute. Read more about [how collective decisions about Solid are made](https://github.com/solid/culture).

The Solid Specification describes a rest api that extends those [existing standards](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/solid-specification.md#standards-used-in-the-solid-specification), contains design notes on the individual components used, and is intended as a guide for developers who plan to build Pods or Solid applications. The Solid specification is modular and extensible and relies as much as possible on existing [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) standards and protocols.

# Use 
There are multiple Solid prototypes that you can use and explore already. 

To get started you will first need to get a [Pod](https://github.com/solid/pods) and then you can use [Solid applications](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps). 

You can also get an [identity provider](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list) that is independent from your Pod and [self host your Pod](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/pods.md#self-hosting-pods) rather than opt for a Pod provider.

## Solid Events 
[Solid Events](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-events.md) provide an opportunity for anyone to meet and talk about Solid in person. Find out more about [organising a Solid Event](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-events.md). 

Find out about upcoming Solid Events or let others know about a Solid Event that you are organising [here](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-events.md).

## Solid Logo and Terms 
You can read a complete set of standardised definitions in the [Solid dictionary](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/solid-dictionary.md) and the [Solid Logo usage guidelines](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-logo-usage-guidelines.md).
